# Repository

[[TOC]]

## Introduction

Generally, we wrote all of our application logic in the controller. Thereâ€™s an alternative approach of development that abstracts some calls into PHP classes called Repositories. The idea is that we can decouple models from controllers and assign a readable name's to complicated queries.

This file defines our Repository class. Instances of this class have a model property that we tie to an Eloquent model. Once this is bound in the constructor we can call Eloquent methods like findOrFail, update or all from the class methods.

- We are using Prettus Repository. You can find all available methods in the Prettus repository from [here](https://github.com/andersao/l5-repository). For now, We are giving some examples below.

  Examples: 

  Sl. no. |  Method               | Description
  ------- |  ------               | ----------- 
  1       | all                   | Find all results in Repository
  2       | paginate              | Find all results in Repository with pagination
  3       | find                  | Find result by id
  4       | with(['table_name'])  | Loading the Model relationships
  5       | findWhereIn           | Find by result by multiple values in one field

  ```php
  // bound in constructor
  public function __construct(protected PostRepository $postRepository) {}
  ```

    ```php
    // Find all results in Repository
    $posts = $this->postRepository->all();
    ```

## Using Bagisto Package Generator

- This command will create a new Repository class in **`packages/Webkul/Blog/src/Repository`** directory.

  ```sh
  php artisan package:make-repository PostRepository Webkul/Blog
  ```

## By Manually Setting up all Files

- Create a **`Repository`** folder inside **`Webkul/Blog/src/`** and create a file **`PostRepository.php`** and create the **`model()`** method in repository class which returns the path of your contract class.

  ```
    - packages/
      - Webkul/Blog/
        - src/
          ...
          - Repository/
            - PostRepository.php
    ```
- After that copy the below code to your newly created repository file. 

  ~~~php
  <?php

  namespace Webkul\Blog\Repository;

  use Webkul\Core\Eloquent\Repository;

  class PostRepository extends Repository
  {
      /**
      * Specify Model class name
      *
      * @return string
      */
      function model(): string
      {
          return 'Webkul\Blog\Contracts\Post';
      }
  }
  ~~~

- Now, You your **`PostRepository`** is ready to use.
