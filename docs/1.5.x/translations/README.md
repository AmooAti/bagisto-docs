# Translation

Bagisto is an open-source e-commerce platform built on Laravel that supports multiple languages. This means that you can translate the platform into different languages to make it more accessible to users from different regions.

If you want to make your website easily accessible to customers in multiple languages and expand your business to a global level, then language translation is imperative for your website.

By default, Bagisto error validations are in English. However, you can change the language of error validations on your store to any language that you want. This guide explains how to do that.
