# Repository

Generally, we wrote all of our application logic in the controller. Thereâ€™s an alternative approach of development that abstracts some calls into PHP classes called Repositories. The idea is that we can decouple models from controllers and assign a readable name's to complicated queries.

This file defines our Repository class. Instances of this class have a model property that we tie to an Eloquent model. Once this is bound in the constructor we can call Eloquent methods like findOrFail, update or all from the class methods.

### Step-1

- Create a `Repository` folder inside `Webkul/Blog/src/` and create a file `PostRepository.php` and create the `model()` method in repository class which returns the path of your contract class.

  ~~~php
  <?php

  namespace Webkul\Blog\Repository;

  use Webkul\Core\Eloquent\Repository;

  class PostRepository extends Repository
  {
      /**
      * Specify Model class name
      *
      * @return string
      */
      function model(): string
      {
          return 'Webkul\Blog\Contracts\Post';
      }
  }
  ~~~

::: tip You can use Bagisto Package Generator
php artisan package:make-repository PostRepository Webkul/Blog
:::

### Step-2

- After creating all the files stated above, we have to create a provider as  `ModuleServiceProvider.php` inside `Webkul/Blog/src/Providers`. In this file, models which are used in this package are registered. You may check below code,

  ~~~php
  <?php

  namespace Webkul\Blog\Providers;

  use Konekt\Concord\BaseModuleServiceProvider;

  class ModuleServiceProvider extends BaseModuleServiceProvider
  {
      protected $models = [
          \Webkul\Blog\Models\Post::class,
      ];
  }
  ~~~

### Step-3

- Now, Register your `ModuleServiceProvider.php` in `config/concord.php` file,

    ~~~php
    <?php

    return [
        'modules' => [
            ...
            \Webkul\Blog\Providers\ModuleServiceProvider::class,
            ...
        ]
    ];
    ~~~

- Now, You your `PostRepository` is ready to use.
